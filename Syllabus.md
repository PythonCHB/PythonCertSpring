# UW Certificate Program in  Programming in Python 

Python 100
Spring, 2013 
March-26 through May 28th, Tuesday, 6 PM 

## Brief Course Description

### Course Objectives

At the end of the class, students will have completed a project of their own choosing, and been exposed to different advanced topics of the python programming language. Most programming class coursework involves small, self contained, assignments. While this is useful for learning specific concepts, it is hard to develop and understanding of the issues associated with larger software projects. This class gives students a chance to develop a significant project with the guidance of the instructors.

### Course Website
Lecture notes, sample code, etc will be available in the course github project:

https://github.com/PythonCHB/PythonCertSpring


## Instructors
Jeff Silverman   `jeffsilverm@gmail.com`

Christopher Barker  `pythonchb@gmail.com`


## Technology Requirements
Students will need a laptop computer with python 2.6.x or 2.7.x and MySQL or PostGres already installed.


##Assessment Criteria & Course Expectations

Students are required to attend 8 out 10 classes, and complete a significant software project in the Python language, either individually or as part of a small group.

Courses in this program are arranged sequentially.  To advance to the next course in this program, students are required to earn a grade of Successful Completion (SC) in this course. Students must successfully complete all courses in the program to receive a certificate of completion.
