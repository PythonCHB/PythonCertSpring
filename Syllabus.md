# UW Certificate Program in  Programming in Python 

Python 100
Spring, 2013 
March-26 through May 28th, Tuesday, 6 PM 

## Brief Course Description

### Course Objectives

At the end of the class, students will have completed a project of their own choosing, and been exposed to different advanced topics of the python programming language. Most programming class coursework involves small, self contained, assignments. While this is useful for learning specific concepts, it is hard to develop and understanding of the issues associated with larger software projects. This class gives students a chance to develop a significant project with the guidance of the instructors.

### Course Website
Lecture notes, sample code, etc will be available in the course github project:

https://github.com/PythonCHB/PythonCertSpring


## Instructors
Jeff Silverman   `jeffsilverm@gmail.com`

Christopher Barker  `pythonchb@gmail.com`


## Technology Requirements
Students will need a laptop computer with python 2.6.x or 2.7.x and MySQL or PostGres already installed.


##Assessment Criteria & Course Expectations

Students are required to attend 8 out 10 classes, and complete a significant software project in the Python language, either individually or as part of a small group.

Courses in this program are arranged sequentially.  To advance to the next course in this program, students are required to earn a grade of Successful Completion (SC) in this course. Students must successfully complete all courses in the program to receive a certificate of completion.


## The class project:

Each student will develop a substantial project throughout the class. It can be an individual project, or a group project with a small group from the class (3-4 students). We suggest that you consider a group project -- it will give you a chance to practice developing with others, as well as give you a built-on way to get code review, folks to bounce ideas off of, etc.

### Requirements:

The project can be anything done primarily in Python: command line utility, desktop GUI, web application, web service, numerical model, smart phone app, you name it. 

The projects should be large enough to take everyone in the group about 8-10 hours a week in addition to class time, but small enough that you can get it to a useful state in 8-9 weeks of the class.

Each project group will be expected to present their work in one of the last two classes. The presentations should be focused on the software design, rather than the problem solved (though, of course, we'll want to know what problem you solved...)

We will expect you to use a Revision Control System (likely github), and employ unit testing.

You should set it up with good package structure -- ready to share and/or deploy.

Write some docs: Sphinx!

Confirm to PEP8 (unless you have a company style instead)

Use PyChecker and/or PyLint and/or PyFlakes

*Please have your project selected and be prepared to start right in on it on day one!*

## Typical class:

Each class will typically begin with a lecture and in-class exercises about the lecture topic, totally 1 -- 1-1/2 hours. 

The remaining class time will be spent working on your projects in consultation with the instructors.

In addition, as we work with you on your projects, we will highlight for the class interesting problems and their solutions that come up in class.
