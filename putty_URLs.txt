     Here's the text for a slide. If I have time, I'd also like to show Pageant so we only have to type a key passphrase once.



     How to:

          * generate a private/public key pair

          * send the public key to the server

          * use nano and paste it in from the Windows clipboard

          * put it into a new .ssh/authorized_keys, or

          * add it to the other keys already there

 

     Use PuTTY and PuTTYgen available from:

          http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

 

     Follow these instructions:

     The non-Windows users won't need any of this. So I have a fun exercise I'd like for them to try, which is to use a 3D tuple to code a Dept. of Trans. classification system described at:
