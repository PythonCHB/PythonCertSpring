PythonCertSpring
================

Site for the UW Continuing Education Program Python Programming Certificate Spring Quarter.

On this site you will find lecture notes, code, etc. for the UW Continuing Education Python Certificate Program Spring Quarter.

See the Sylabus here: https://github.com/PythonCHB/PythonCertSpring/blob/master/Syllabus.md

In the source code section of the site, you'll find a directory for each class session.
In each of those, you'll find lecture notes (source and PDF) and sample code for the excercises.

We suggest you clone the git repository on your machine, so you can work with the code,
but do be sure to do an update (`git pull`) at the beginning of each class, so that you'll
have the latest version of everything.
