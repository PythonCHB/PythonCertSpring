"""
A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument.
For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument
and calls it twice:
def do_twice(f):
    f()
    f()
Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.
def print_spam():
    print 'spam'

do_twice(print_spam)
Type this example into a script and test it.
Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value,
and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.
Write a more general version of print_spam, called print_twice, that takes a
string as a parameter and prints it twice.  Use the modified version of do_twice
to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.
Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and
calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be
only two statements in the body of this function, not four.
