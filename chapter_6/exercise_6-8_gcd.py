# Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor
# One way to find the GCD of two numbers is Euclidâ€™s algorithm, which is based
# on the observation that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then
# gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). As a base case, we can use gcd(a, 0) = a.

    if b == 0 :
        return a

        r = a % b

    """This function verifies that the GCD of a and b is g """
    gt = gcd ( a, b )
    if gt == g :
        print "The GCD of ",a, b, "is, in fact, ", g

        print "PROBLEM: the GCD of ",a,b, "should be ",g, "but ",gt, "was returned"
