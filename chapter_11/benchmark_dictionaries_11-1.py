# Exercise 11-1
# Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in
# a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in
# operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.
#
# If you did Exercise 10.8, you can compare the speed of this implementation
# with the list in operator and the bisection search.
